# build aws code to setup machine learnig center

Setting up a machine learning center on AWS requires a combination of services to be deployed in a specific way. Here are the general steps to create a machine learning center on AWS:

Create an AWS account if you don't have one already.

Create an Amazon SageMaker notebook instance to access Jupyter notebooks, and then choose the required instance size, storage volume size, and other configurations as per your needs.

Create an Amazon S3 bucket to store the data you need for your machine learning projects.

Create an IAM role with the necessary permissions to allow SageMaker to access your S3 bucket and any other AWS services you plan to use.

Use Amazon SageMaker to train a machine learning model with your data. This involves selecting an appropriate algorithm, tuning its parameters, and then executing the training process.

Deploy the trained machine learning model to an Amazon SageMaker endpoint.

Use the Amazon SageMaker API to invoke the endpoint and generate predictions on new data.

Here is a module.py example code to set up an Amazon SageMaker notebook instance:
